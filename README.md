# Hi, my name is Sajad Jalilian

I’m an old-time geek! I love programming and creating web applications. I Try to write code for humans, machines eventually will understand it anyway!! I believe in minimalism in life and code, Less is better.

I'm interested in the whole web application development life cycle; from small apps with a handful of users to hundreds of microservices with millions of users. Engineering, designing, and implementing them just excite me.
