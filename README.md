# Hi, my name is Sajad Jalilian

I’m an old-time geek who loves programming. I Try to write code for humans; machines eventually will understand it anyway! I believe in minimalism in life and the code, Less code to write means less code to maintain!

Before anything, I consider myself a valuable tool to solve problems; It doesn't matter what kind of problems I face; I will find the most reasonable solution for it, sooner or later.
