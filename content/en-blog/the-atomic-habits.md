At this moment if a youngster asks me for a self-help book to change his/her life drastically. I choose "Atomic Habits" by James Clear.
I highly suggest reading this book more than once!

The latest episode of the "ReThinking" podcast; the great conversation between Adam Grant and James was so insightful and exciting for me so I decided to share this post with you.
