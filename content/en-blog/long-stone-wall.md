When I decided to change my whole life and pursue software development, I was wondering what is to be like a developer? what can best describe the everyday work of a developer?

Now, I think I figured it out!

"Every engineering job, especially software development is like making a long stone wall, you have the big picture in mind, you don't know exactly how to do it! you will figure it out one stone at the time"
