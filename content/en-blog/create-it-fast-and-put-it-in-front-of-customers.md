This talk was so inspirational for me.

I always kind of know some of things these guys are talk about from my prior experience on creating business in the past and reading about startups, but hearing it form four different technical founder with four totally different products was very reassuring.

If you have an idea, go for it. Create it fast, and put it in front of customers as fast as you can.

If you are like me and enjoy creating stuff, I recommend watching this talk by ycombinator.
