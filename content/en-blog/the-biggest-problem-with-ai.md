## How I think of AI

The "Artificial Intelligence"! I don't think the thing we refer as AI is Intelligence at all. It's a glorified search engine. A machine learning algorithm that is trained on billions of tokens. It looks at the "Dataset" and creates patterns. For example you give it a dataset with photos of different animals, you show the algorithm a picture of cat and say "This is a cat", and you repeat it with millions of cat pictures.

This way machine-learning algorithm creates cluster of "IF" statement automatically and internally. Then; when you show it a cat pictures, that cluster of "IF"s calculates variables of the picture and predicts that is a cat.

## The clock problem

Ask a "AI" system to create image of clock right now. Most of the time the clock it created shows 10:10.

But why? The reason is in alost all pictures you see on the mechanical clocks show 10:10 because its visually more pleasing to people.

## The biggest problem : "Normal distribution"

The "Normal distribution" or the "dataset" problem!

We don't usually ask AI about cat pictures. We ask about all sorts of complex problems. Engineering and scientific ones. How AI suppose to answer these kind os questions?

All the natural data in the world follows "Normal distribution" pattern. Lets say we want to use AI to answer out questions about Software engineering. The problem is code bases follow the "Normal distribution" too!
We want the best result, the best answers. But very small percentage of the code is great code. When the AI trained of those code bases because it see a lot of not so good code, it creates not so good or at best very average code and answers to our questions.

Basically ML values quantity, not quality. For that reason the answers we get from AI is reflection of average poorly written code and it is low quality.
