Sometimes I see posts on Linkedin where people complain about terrible codebases and blame the development team. But it's not that simple.
The "big ball of mud" is created slowly over a long period of time. The codebase contains a corporate structure that is reflected in the code over a period of time. Every time that structure changes, every time a team or code design decisions changes, old code doesn't just go away!

I highly recommend watching "Where Does Bad Code Come From?" a great talk by "Casey Muratori".
