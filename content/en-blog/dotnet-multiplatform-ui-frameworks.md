When I was first dipping my toe into the .NET ecosystem, my main disappointment was not finding A robust multiplatform UI framework to create Desktop and mobile applications. Later .NET MAUI came along, but it didn't support Linux(my favorite OS).

Later I found two remarkable frameworks, "Avalonia" and "Uno"; I can sleep well at night now :)

You should check them out.
