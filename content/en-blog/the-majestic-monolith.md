Recently, I've been pondering over the ideas presented in "The Majestic Monolith" by [David Heinemeier Hansson](https://dhh.dk). I've come to realize that my thought process is quite similar to his. We both believe in being practical and getting things done efficiently while ensuring the best possible outcome.

Being a software engineer who has worked with microservices for most of my career and a fan of Fight Club, I strongly believe in the first rule of microservices club - which is not to join the club.
