Yesterday, I accidentally found my VisualBasic certificate from 2007. More than 16 years have passed since that date! Time really flies!
I remember searching the whole city for a software company, but I couldn't find one. Back then, I wasn't able to move to a bigger city, so life happened, and years passed.

I'm writing this to say that "environmental determinism" is real. I can't help but wonder if there had been a software company in our city, I could have pursued programming. Instead of 4 years of experience, maybe I would have had 16 years!

When I moved to Tehran in 2020 and landed my first job, I had two co-workers who were 19 and 20 years old. They were doing internships at our company, and I envied them.
Even today, it is very hard to find an internship or a job opportunity in smaller cities in Iran. I always counsel young people to move to the capital city as soon as they can if they want to be programmers.
