I'm listening to the "Keep Coding Podcast" from Nick Chapsas with Stephen Toub. How Stephen is showing mastery in moving conversation forward, explaining stuff with detailed examples, and the general quality of delivering his knowledge is blowing my mind.
I can not stop asking myself "Where is he on the internet?" "Why he is not all over the conferences?". He even doesn't have anything on his LinkedIn or Twitter accounts!
It made me think about my presence on the internet. Maybe sometimes all we need is to create things and write about them in blog posts! just like the good old days.
