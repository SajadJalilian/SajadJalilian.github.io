I have a selective memory. This means my brain excels at recognizing things I can quickly recover from external sources and then promptly forgets them!
That's why I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) as a second brain, creating cheat sheets for things I encounter daily. If you ask me about something I only do once a month, I likely won't recall the specifics (they're easily found through AI, Obsidian, Google, etc.). But I can access and utilize the information within a minute.

P.S. Maybe it's the other way around! By writing things down or knowing where to look them up, I forget them because I rely on these external resources.
