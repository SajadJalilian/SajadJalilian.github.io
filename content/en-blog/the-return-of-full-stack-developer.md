The "Return of Full-Stack Developer"
I have been thinking about this for a couple of months now.

But why?
1- Interest rates are back to normal!
2- Full-Stack devs can fill in everywhere!
3- AI helps with things a lot.

Many of you blame mass layoffs on the rise of AI, the bad economy, or even Elon Musk after firing 80% of the Twitter workforce. But the real reason is that "Free money" dried up after the rise in interest rates in the US after a decade!

Engineers are expensive! without free VC money companies are rethinking their development strategy. At this point they don't want to grow fast, they want to survive in the long marathon and the Full-Stack devs save them money.
