After watching a recent "Tucker Carlson" interview with "Pavel Durov", the creator and owner of Telegram, four things he mentioned shocked me.

- A total team of 30 people handles all of hashtag#Telegram with over 900 million users!
- NSA tried to convince one of the top engineers to use CERTAIN OPEN SOURCE LIBRARIES
- After trying many countries like the USA and Germany, they found out that the UAE is the best place to start a tech company.
- They don't have an HR department and they hold coding contests every month and hire the best of the best when they need to!
