This marks the beginning of my journey back into blogging. I wrote my first blog post back in 2004, but I was just a hobby blogger and didn't really focus on creating quality content. I aim to change that now. This is my first attempt at doing so.

My main focus is on software engineering and programming, but I also occasionally explore other interesting topics that I'm passionate about.

Wish me luck on this new endeavor :)
