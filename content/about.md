### Hi, my name is Sajad Jalilian

I'm an old-time geek. I'll never forget the first time I saw a computer. It felt like a portal to the world, an ocean of knowledge and opportunities. I owe everything I am and everything I know to the computer and the internet.

Days spent sitting in front of the computer, learning, playing games, and creating things â€“ what a journey!

### Love of nature

One of my favorite things is to spend time outdoors, exploring the wilderness and honing my Survival and Bushcraft skills. Staying active and playing sports is also essential as it helps me feel physically and mentally healthy.

If I can make something I need; I like to make it myself. I love working with my tools.

Additionally, I'm a certified woodworker and cabinetmaker. I've always been drawn to working with wood because of my love for nature, and there's nothing quite like the smell of it.

### My Principles

- **Honest**: If something is wrong, I will do my best to face reality. I'm honest not only with myself, but also with my colleagues, the company, and the Code! I will do my best to face problems and find the best way to solve them in a way that helps individuals, teams, and the company.

- **Pragmatic**: I get the job done! I believe that everything has a trade-off; we should gather all the knowledge we can about our problem and do our best to find the best solution. That's all that matters.

- **Simple!**: I love the KISS (Keep it simple silly) principle. Every component added to a system means another component to maintain. Any living system tends to increase complexity. Keeping systems simple and avoiding complexity takes effort and art.

- **Owner**: For 7 years I was my own boss and had two small personal businesses. I know the challenges involved. It's not easy to deal with employees; you have to make different sacrifices to achieve your goals, bring money into the business, and maintain a healthy environment at the same time.
